In this tutorial, I will cover:

- How to define a `FormSchema` type class.
- How to create a Zod schema and enhance its security using `FormSchema`.
- How to integrate `useForm` with your forms.
- Strategies for securing your forms using both `useForm` and `FormSchema`.
- Managing API calls efficiently with `useForm` and handling the `isSubmitting` state.

Additionally, I have created a post on my personal blog [insert link here] and a tutorial video in French.
